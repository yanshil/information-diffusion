# Overview:
This is a reiteration of a AAAI'15 paper: [RAIN: Social Role-Aware Information Diffusion][1]

The paper proposed a novel model that integrates social role recognition and diffusion into a unified framework. Plus a Gibbs sampling based algorithm is developed to learn the proposed model using historical diffusion data. Here we use Python to complement the algorithm using the open-source data provided by the author.

The data set from Tencent Blog can be downloaded [here][2].
